If you’re between 18 and 35 (or within one year of having graduated from school, or currently in school) there’s a good chance you can take advantage of a working holiday visa. Some visas are limited to those between 18 and 30, so check them all if you’re interested.

Working holiday visas are usually for one year and not renewable, so it’s not a pathway to citizenship. You’re typically allowed to work for 40 hours per week.
