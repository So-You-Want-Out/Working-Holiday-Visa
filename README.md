# Working-Holiday-Visa

Working holiday visas are typically for one year and are not a means to citizenship. However, like the name states, you can work on this visa, so it may be a pathway to a work permit.

Most working holiday visas are open to anyone ages 18 to 30 (or 35). Ireland, however, has no age requirments. You must only be in school or within 1 year of graduation to be eligible for an Irish working holiday visa.

Working holiday visas are usually for one year and not renewable, so it’s not a pathway to citizenship. You’re typically allowed to work for 40 hours per week.

Ireland allows you to have multiple working holiday visas over the course of your lifetime but you must exit the country in between each visa and the time spent on a working holiday visa does not count as reconable residence, which is the time that counts towards permanent residency / citizenship.
    
Australia allows up to 3 working holiday visas.
