# Working-Holiday-Visa

Working holiday visas are typically for one year and are not a means to citizenship. However, like the name states, you can work on this visa, so it may be a pathway to a work permit.

Most working holiday visas are open to anyone ages 18 to 30 (or 35). Ireland, however, has no age requirments. You must only be in school or within 1 year of graduation to be eligible for an Irish working holiday visa.
